# Python Inventory Project

This repository contains a Python-based inventory management system. The project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for tracking and managing inventory for businesses or personal use.

## Features

The Python Inventory project includes the following features:

1. Item Management: Users can add, view, update, and delete items in the inventory. Each item can have attributes such as name, quantity, price, and category.

2. Search Functionality: Users can search for specific items in the inventory by name, category, or other attributes. The search results are displayed dynamically.

3. Inventory Reports: Users can generate reports on the current inventory status, including the total number of items, the total value of the inventory, and other relevant statistics.

4. Data Persistence: The inventory data is stored in a persistent manner, allowing users to save and load the inventory from a file. This ensures data integrity and allows for future use.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python: The core programming language used for implementing the inventory management system.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project follows OOP principles to structure the codebase and model the inventory items.
- File I/O: Python's file input/output operations are used for saving and loading the inventory data.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): The project can be interacted with via a command-line interface, providing a straightforward user experience.
